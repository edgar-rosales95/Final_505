# ADS505 Final Project: Illuminating Black Money

Team 2 Collaborators: Christian Lee, Bobby Marriott, Edgar Rosales

## Background:
The rampant increase in the movement of illegal money threatens the validity of the global financial system. The company is currently under significant regulatory and political pressure to address the rise in illegal financial transactions through our network where we have been approached by both Congressional committees and the SEC to provide an immediate plan of action to mitigate the flow of “black” money throughout the system. Our data collected from 2013-2014 shows that 10% of all transactions originate from illegal sources. We seek to identify future illegal transactions so they can be flagged and inspected by our fraud team, ultimately resulting in the freezing of accounts determined to originate from illegal activities. By leveraging predictive modeling to quickly and economically identify these illegal transactions, we will be able to protect our shareholders from the threat of regulatory penalties as well as fulfill our commitment to administering the financial systems as pertains to the law of our host nations.


## Objective:
We aim to build a classification model that can accurately predict 90% of all illegal transactions. Several models will be evaluated including, Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, and LightGBM Classifier. It is expected that the most performant model may falsely identify some transactions as illegal, but this is acceptable so long as it does not unnecessarily cause a costly burden/inconvenience to the majority of our customers. The business is advised to utilize this model to investigate the flagged transactions so that their transactors can be properly verified and audited. Those accounts that are identified as originating from illegal sources are to be reported to the relevant government authorities and the results and methodologies shared with our shareholders and overseeing regulatory agencies.
